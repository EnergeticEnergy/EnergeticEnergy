- 👋 Hi, I’m @EnergeticEnergy
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Game development and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... The Unity engine, along with C#, I am also taking college classes to learn HTM, and I like to try and learn some miscelaneous languages on the side. Like C, C++, Javascript and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Nothing at the moment, currently working on a VR title for Oculus Quest 2 (maybe Quest 1 as well) and I am just working on some basic stuff like interaction.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Nowhere just yet, unless you have an issue with a bug or something. I guess just go to the issue or pull request tabs.
